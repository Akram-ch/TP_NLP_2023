French Sentiment Analysis Dataset with Television Series Reviews
http://sentiment.nlproc.org/

This is a preprocessed version of the Allocin√© dataset from
https://www.irit.fr/~Tim.Van-De-Cruys/tal/tp/tp3/tp3.pdf
We are providing it for better reproducibility of the results in our papers cited below.

=== Data Format ===

There are three separate tab-separated value (TSV) files for the
training/development/test sets, respectively.

The first item in each file is the label (1: positive, 0: negative).
The second item is the text, with some basic preprocessing applied
(tokenization with space separated tokens, lower-casing).
