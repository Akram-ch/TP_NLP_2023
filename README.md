# TP_NLP_2023
Here practical work for the course "Communication Langagière" in 2023, at Université Grenoble Alpes

## Installation

Here, for all the practical works (excepted the first one related to Unix commands), we work with jupyter notebook. It goes without saying that the same objective can also be achieved through a multitude of ways, including using a text editor, or google colab. To Install the needed environment for the TPs, after installing the last version of [Miniconda3](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) (or Anaconda3, if you want a graphical interface), run the following commands:

````
conda create -n "TP_NLP_2023" python=3.8 # creates the environment
conda activate TP_NLP_2023  # activates the environment
conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab  # installs jupyterlab on the environment
````
